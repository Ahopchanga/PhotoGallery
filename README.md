# PhotoGallery Project 

This is an ASP.NET MVC application combined with React and Entity Framework code-first. It follows clean architecture and DDD principles, providing a maintainable and well-organized codebase.

## Note

Being new to React, the frontend is still undergoing refinement and expected to improve over time.

## Repository Structure 

The repository is organized into seven projects:

1. **.Web**: Presents the user interface components in React.
2. **.App**: Acts as a mediator between the .Web layer and the .Data layer, facilitating data exchanges and operational flow.
3. **.Data**: Accesses the system's databases.
4. **Domain**: Contains all domain-specific components. 

There are also three `.Tests` projects catering to the testing requirements of the application.
